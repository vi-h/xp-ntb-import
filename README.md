## Installation

Install this application from Enonic Market.

## Usage

### Configuration

When you add the NTB Import application to your *site*, you have to configure three fields.

 1. Folder where articles are stored
 2. Publisher id (8 digit number from NTB)
 3. Channels (8 digit number from NTB)

### Manual Article Import

You can manually run an import by running the  `ntb-import` service, which can be found on the following url-path: 
*/_/service/no.item.ntb/ntb-import*

### Automatic Article Import

The application has a [cron job](./src/main/resources/main.ts) that runs an import job **every hour on the hour**. If there 
are new articles on your NTB Channel, they will be imported into XP as 
[NTB Article](./src/main/resources/site/content-types/ntb-article/ntb-article.xml) content. The  **su** user is set as 
the owner of the new content.

### Displaying NTB Article

You have to write the code generate the HTML based on the `NTB Article` in your own application.

If you are using [TypeScript](https://github.com/ItemConsulting/enonic-types/), you can use 
[this interface](./src/main/resources/site/content-types/ntb-article/ntb-article.d.ts) to interact with the objects created by this library.

```typescript
export interface NtbArticle {
  title: string;
  leadtext: string;
  body: string;
  imageId?: string;
  images?: Array<string>;
  links?: Array<{
    url: string;
    description: string;
  }>;
  keywords?: Array<string>;
  ntbId: number;
  published: string;
  url: string;
  type: string;
  publisherId: number;
  channelId: number;
  language: string;
}
```
